# Parallax-Website
This is a demo website.
I have added a parallax effect.
Scroll bar has been modified.
At the top left corner, you can see the scroll progress in percentage and there is a progress bar at the top and left sides.
The navbar has clickable buttons with hover effects.
Clicking on the hamburger icon at the top left corner will slide open a floating menu.
